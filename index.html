          <h3>My first learning step</h3>
          <p>
            I didn't have computer at first, so i started learning HTML on the
            freeCodeCamp on my mobile FCC. I started reading their theories,
            their structure, their system behavior, how it works. There are
            labs, workshops, there are theories on the freeCodeCamp, i studied
            them well and practiced them. I studied them on the mobile FCC and
            practiced them. Now my position is very high level to biuld web
            pages structure, i am doing projects with my mind and them with my
            hard work. freeCodeCamp is one of the best platform and organization
            in the world for web development. I really like its teaching system
            and i am still trying hard to gain full experience on it for
            building projects.

          <h2>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h2>
          <p>
            After HTML, i started learning CSS and its theories at first with
            practicing workshops and labs. freeCodeCamp has helped me a lot in
            understanding it. It has clearly explained the concepts and provided
            practical examples to reinforce learning. So it is up to you to work
            hard and understand it. I have no teacher, no one to explain, but i
            have reached this position by asking questions from freeCodeCamp
            help and studying on freeCodeCamp. I have adopted every method that
            freeCodeCamp taught me and if i have not understood something, i
            have re-learned it. I am still learning and improving my skills. And
            in the same way, i have achieved a lot of success and now i am doing
            projects.

          <h2>JavaScript (JS)</h2>
          <p>
            After CSS, i have learned JavaScript up to its functions and have
            read the theories and gained experience, but i have not learned
            JavaScript completely and i have to try my best to learn it at the
            freeCodeCamp. Insha Allah, i will succeed in this too. Just like i
            have learned HTML and CSS and my position is better and i can do
            projects, i cannot include JavaScript in my projects because i have
            not learned it completely yet and i am trying my best to complete
            JavaScript curriculum on freeCodeCamp.
